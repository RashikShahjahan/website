I am Sadman, a Software Engineering student at University of Waterloo, graduating
in April, 2019. I have a wide range of interests and experience in graphics, network,
security, game programming, robotics, NLP, AI, etc. Currently looking for full-time
positions starting in Fall 2019.

My most recent career adventures have been in the field of deep learning infrastructures.
I started off at a start-up building a new processor unit and system for acceleration
of deep learning algorithms called Wave Computing. Following that, I spent two four-
month internships at NVIDIA, first working on an intelligent on-premise home security
application for Shield TV and later moved on to work on making self-driving cars
smarter.

I have previously worked at Deloitte's d{} innovation lab building a real-time
communications architecture for the mining sector, worked on Autodesk Live, an
arch-viz product using game engine concepts, and worked at Extreme Networks
contributing to their wireless LAN controller product. I was also a former lead for
my university's Nano robotics groups' software team, and have won several competitions
internationally as part of the team.

I spend a lot of my free time exploring various programming fields, through building
side projects, reading books, and researching opinions. My focus throughout my
undergraduate career has been to explore breadth-first into various fields. I am
currently interested in working on AI and platform engineering (or some combination
of both).

I maintain a bunch of techy hobbies, such as getting the most out of open source
projects. I love DIY projects: My [Gaming Computer](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/XRXH99),
or even my personal [server](https://io.sadmansk.com), where I host my own
[git server](https://git.sadmansk.com), my [website](https://sadmansk.com),
[blog](https://blog.sadmansk.com), and for my family's usage: [cloud](https://drive.dispersio.us),
[music server](https://sonic.dispersio.us), matrix server (find me at sadman@dispersio.us),
and a [mastodon](https://mastodon.social/) [instance](https://twit.dispersio.us).

I also enjoy writing a lot, which usually entails helping people find privacy advice
or some tech adventure I found myself in the middle of. A few years ago, I rediscovered
the joy of reading because apparently that's what smart people do (lol?), but it
has actually been really great. I read mostly educational books about programming,
and non-fiction, but also fiction every now and then.

The non-geeky stuff that I do includes: playing the guitar, singing and recording
(stay tuned for when my album drops in the near future), fitness stuff, also love
hiking, playing soccer, ping pong and volleyball in my free time. Whale watching
is my favourite activity.

I'm currently looking for full-time opportunities starting in Fall 2019. Take a
