I am Sadman, a Software Engineering student at University of Waterloo. I have a
wide range of interests and experience in graphics, network, security, game
programming, robotics, NLP, AI, etc. 

I have previously worked at Deloitte's d{} innovation lab building a real-time
communications architecture for the mining sector, worked on Autodesk Live, an
arch-viz product using game engine concepts, and worked at Extreme Networks
contributing to their wireless LAN controller product. I'm currently also leading
my university's Nano robotics groups' software team, and have won several competitions
internationally as part of the team.

I spend a lot of my free time exploring various programming fields, through building
side projects, reading books, and researching opinions. My focus right now is to
go breadth first so that I can cover as much ground as I can and then make the
right choice when the time comes in terms of which of the major computing fields
I would want to explore.

I maintain a bunch of techy hobbies, such as getting the most out of open source
projects. I love building stuff by myself, and other DIY stuff: My [Gaming
Computer](https://ca.pcpartpicker.com/b/XRXH99), or even my personal [server](https://io.sadmansk.com),
where I host my own [git server](https://git.sadmansk.com), my [website](https://sadmansk.com),
[blog](https://blog.sadmansk.com), personal [syncthing](https://syncthing.net)
[instance](https://sync.sadmansk.com) (password protected), etc. Also there are
other projects that I'm in the process of deploying, such as CozyCloud,  Matrix,
Diaspora, and other projects that I come across. 

I also like writing a lot, which usually entails very unpopular opinion or some
tech adventure I found myself in the middle of. Recently I picked up more reading
because apparently that's what smart people do (lol?), but it has actually been
pretty great. I read mostly educational books about programming, but also read
other types of both fiction and non-fiction books every now and then. Other than
those, I play the guitar, and love playing soccer, ping pong and volleyball in
my free time.

I'm currently looking for an internship for the summer of 2017. Be sure to take
a look at my [resume](https://sadmansk.com/resume.pdf), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sadmansk)
and [developer story](https://stackoverflow.com/story/sadmansk).
