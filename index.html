<a name="about-me" class="anchor" href="#about-me"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About me</h3>

<p>I am a computer enthusiast. It includes everything from building computers to gaming to programming. Yes, programming, I love doing that. I love making things that can live by themselves. I love solving problems that I find challenging. I think that's why I am so passionate about programming; yeah that's definitely the main reason. Who I want to become? I like gaming, and I have a keen eye to every small detail posed in my sights. Have you watched the "The Division - E3 2014 Cinematic Trailer" on YouTube? Well I watched it around twenty times, not (only) because I am a geek, but because I try to find things that I have missed; to find minute details that I have missed the first twenty times. Oh, I was talking about who I want to become. Game Engine developer is definitely near the top of my list. My passion is fueled by the hundreds of games I have played and the thousands of videos I have watched on YouTube that focuses on the depth of the physics engines used to make the games a success. Another top contender on my wish list is becoming an AI programmer; the human mind quite amazes me, and I would love to attempt to make similar intelligence. Oh, and I'm also into Physics, specifically the Space-Time fabric and the Theories of Relativity.</p>
