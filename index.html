I am a computer enthusiast. It includes everything from building computers to gaming to programming. Yes, programming, I love doing that. I love making things that can live by themselves. I love solving problems that I find challenging. I think that's why I am so passionate about programming; yeah that's definitely the main reason. Who I want to become? I like gaming, and I have a keen eye to every small detail posed in my sights. Have you watched the "The Division - E3 2014 Cinematic Trailer" on YouTube? Well I watched it around twenty times, not (only) because I am a geek, but because I try to find things that I have missed; to find minute details that I have missed the first twenty times. Oh, I was talking about who I want to become. Game Engine developer is definitely near the top of my list. My passion is fueled by the hundreds of games I have played and the thousands of videos I have watched on YouTube that focuses on the depth of the physics engines used to make the games a success. Another top contender on my wish list is becoming an AI programmer; the human mind quite amazes me, and I would love to attempt to make similar intelligence. Oh, and I'm also into Physics, specifically the Space-Time fabric and the Theories of Relativity.

<h5><a href="\eclipse.html">Eclipse</a> <em>(July 2014)</em></h5>
<p>Eclipse is a 3d Android game that I developed for fun on my free time. I am in charge of the entire development part of the game, including but not limited to: back end, front end, scripting, texturing, scene set up, and lighting.I am using Unity3d as the game engine and C# for the scripting of the game objects. You can download the current alpha version here - <a href="downloads/Eclipsice_v042" target="_blank">Eclipse v0.42</a> <em>(Released on 27th August, 2014)</em>.</p>

<h5><a href="https://github.com/unknown2374/PokemonAmethyst" target="new">Pokémon Amethyst</a> <em>(June 2014)</em></h5>
<p>I developed a fully functional role playing game, based off the popular game/cartoon series franchise Pokémon. I was in charge of the back end, game logic, game play elements and most of the graphical elements in the game. The program includes more than ten different Java classes. You can download the game <a href="downloads/PokemonAmethyst.jar" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<h5><a href="https://github.com/unknown2374/PokerGame" target="new">Poker Hand Algorithms</a> <em>(June 2013)</em></h5>
<p>As I was working on a poker game as the summative for my grade 11 computer science class, I was in charge of the back end of the program. I developed fairly complex algorithms that could check and categorize the poker rank of the different hands in the game. 
I later wrote a program to test my algorithms on each of the rank checkers by checking one billion different hands and comparing the probability with the theoretical probability of each hand, the results proved my algorithm to be accurate.</p>
