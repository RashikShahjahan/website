## Setup
You need [hugo](https://gohugo.io) installed in order to build the site. Once you
have that downloaded, run the `hugo` command to build the site, which puts the
generated files in a `public/` folder. You could also run `hugo server` and navigate
to `localhost:1313` in your browser to see your generated site. If you want to learn
more about using hugo, [their official docs](https://gohugo.io/overview/usage/)
is a great resource.
